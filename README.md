# COMP360: Programming Languages
### Project 2

Goal: An object-oriented programming language supports abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance is a means for incrementally building new types from an existing parent type by inheriting, modifying, or adding to both the existing components and operations of the parent type. Inheritance greatly supports reuse in the software development process. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is another technique that provides a friendly environment for users. Students will practice these techniques in this project.
